th = 1.6
width = lambda/2
top metal  - positive
bottom - negative - ground plane
f = 5Ghz
lambda = 60
l = 60
l = n*lambda
material = copper
substrate = FR4 epoxy
ground = rectangle sheet - thicknes 0.017mm
metal thickness = 0.017mm
l is same for all
if sheet : { boundary = perfectly }


2. create rectangle {width - metal's width }-> assighn excitation _. lumped port  new line , middle to the top

radiation box - > rightclick, create open region , frequency - 4ghz
assign radiation boundary

analysis _> setup -> 5 GHZ
passes = 10
add sweep - 4 to 6 ghz
sweep type = fast


er = 4.4 -> dielectric constant
h = 1.6mm
f = 5ghz
z0 = 50 ohms
electrical length = 90 degree

ws = 3.05mm
l = 8.21 mm

which box

substrate = 0.017mm
above - 0.16,
metal strip - 0.017mm


lab 4 instructions

far field report -> radiation pattern

theta should vary from -180 to 180 .... ps radiation pattern
